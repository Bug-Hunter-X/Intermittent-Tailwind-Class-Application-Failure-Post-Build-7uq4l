```javascript
// potential solution: Refactoring of the class usage or rebuild process. 
//This is a complex issue with many possible roots, a specific solution depends on the exact cause.
//Example of a refactoring approach:
//Instead of:
//<div class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 p-4 text-white">
//<div class="bg-blue-500 p-4 text-white hover:bg-blue-700">
//Consider a more structured approach using separate class names for better maintainability.
