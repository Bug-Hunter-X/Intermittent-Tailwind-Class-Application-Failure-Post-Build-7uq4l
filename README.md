# Intermittent Tailwind Class Application Failure Post-Build

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered with Tailwind CSS where classes fail to be applied after the build process. The problem appears inconsistently and might be related to the order of class declarations or conflicts with other CSS frameworks. 

## Bug Description
Tailwind classes are not consistently applied post-build.  This happens intermittently and is not readily reproducible with a simple example. The issue is suspected to be associated with complex class interactions and build pipeline configurations.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the build process (instructions provided in package.json).
3. Observe the inconsistencies in Tailwind class application.  Note: The bug may not manifest on every build.

## Solution
The solution might involve adjusting the build process, resolving CSS conflicts, or refactoring the class usage patterns.
